# hello-world
My first github repository

Hi all, this is my first dabble into version control and using git. As i'm improving my development skills I intend to run everything through git to track my progress and using it as a portfolio of work.

I've added this additional line from my home computer after installing github for mac. I'm attempting to get all the version control working properly from within the app rather than using the web setup.
